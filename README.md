# byfron-bypass

a byfron bypass i made for nyx originally. its buggy as hell. but it works ig.

method is manual mapping sigma injection along with a driver

**important:**
- your dll file must be called Nyx.dll and must be put in the C:\
- the injector must also be in C:\ along with the driver BattlEye.sys
- **NO** files can be renamed. if you dont like it womp womp then

**what should happen**
- the injector plays a beep sound if everything went right. if it doesnt, your code is WRONG

thanks to nameless ct for making it w me! rip nlhybrid. hes the one who made it originally.

**THIS IS NOT OPEN SOURCE STOP ASKING ME FOR THE CODE. THIS IS JUST A SAMPLE.**
